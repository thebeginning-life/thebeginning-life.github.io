## Why this project is necessary

My experience speaking with others of my generation (commonly known as generation X) about the Bible and about Christianity has been that, most people are aware of the Bible meanings of theological words and ideas as presented in modern translations.  

For example, people in my generation generally know what a Christian means when s/he uses words like "sin", "repent", "righteous", "Satan", "evil spirit, unclean spirit, demon", etc.  And many in my generation have a cultural understanding of the Good News--at least enough to be innoculated to it and have their preconceived reasons for rejecting it.  That is the bad news.

However, the good news for my generation is that many who are hungry to know the God of the Bible already have the required background to understand the Bible using many of the excellent modern translations.

On the other hand (in my own experience) many from the younger generation that is coming of age right now have none of this background understanding of theological terms needed to become a disciple of Jesus.

This is both an opportunity and a challenge.

### The hunger

In my experience, I have never met a group of people more hungry to know about God generally and the God of the Bible specifically than this younger generation.  I regularly experience members of this generation immediately ask me to teach them how to know God as soon as they learn that I am a Christian.

### The challenge

Unfortunately, my experience has also been that when they try to read modern Bible translations these same people quickly bog down in technical theological terms like those listed above and lose interest.  Forcing technical theological terms on new disciples of Jesus right at the beginning of their walk in my own experience has proven profoundly counter-productive to the Church's mission to make disciples of Jesus Christ.

### The opportunity

Mark's stated objective at the start of his book is to present "the *beginning* of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."  

And I believe that if we take Mark's word as gospel (inspired by the Holy Spirit) this offers a simple, straightforward, and direct way to become a true disciple of Jesus Christ as well as to make disciples of Jesus Christ as he commanded.

The *Romans Road,* the *four spiritual laws,* along with programs like *Evangelism Explosion* and others have borne fruit.  Many have found their way to becoming a disciple of Jesus through these synopses of the Good News.

But I believe that starting with Mark (because he alone claims to start at the beginning) and studying sequentially and *inductively* offers a more direct road into Jesus the Truth, Christ the Door, Jesus the Way, and Jesus the Life.  This approach depends simply on obtaining a faithful translation of Mark that itself translates these theological and/or cultural terms into understandable colloquial spoken English that any random native English speaker would readily comprehend.

I haven't been able to find others with this vision, so I am beginning this work myself, in the open, hoping that others with skillsets complimenting my own offer their own expertise.  And hoping that in the end this work becomes an effort representative of the Body of Christ herself and her mission to effectively make disciples of Jesus before the last day comes.

### My own skillset

I became a disciple of Jesus Christ as a middle-schooler and have been a passionate student of the Bible since.  While I have experienced seasons during which my strength or my total commitment to Jesus has faltered, I have never let go of my fundamental profound desire to be a disciple of Jesus and a student of the Bible.

I am not a Hebrew or Greek scholar but my wife is a Biblical Hebrew scholar and I'm not afraid of Greek interlinears and/or Hebrew/Greek lexicons.  These are a regular part of my personal study of the Scriptures.

Regarding Bible translation, I served a summer internship with Wycliffe Bible Translators as a high school student, grew up in the same church as Ken Taylor who originally updated the ASV--the result being published as The Living Bible paraphrase.  I am a friendly acquaintance of Mark Taylor (Ken's son), and am familiar with many of the theological and political considerations surrounding a "layperson" updating an existing translation and having it remain properly a trustworthy translation instead of a "mere paraphrase."

My main personal weakness is that I have very little background in textual criticism, and while I understand some fundamental principles such as "the 'harder reading' more likely being original" I cannot hope to evaluate alternate renderings myself the way a scholar with this training could.  To remediate this deficiency, I am relying on scholarly textual notes in the NET Bible 2.0, other study Bibles, and other readily-available scholarly resources.  And if any of these suggest an alternate rendering to be more accurate than the traditional ASV translation, I'll cite my source(s)--probably in a footnote but this is undecided as this concern has yet to present itself.

Naturally, if a scholar with experience in Bible translation and (particularly with) expertise in textual criticism wishes to help address any possible weaknesses I bring in this area, I would be delighted to collaborate.

## Guiding principles

My goal in preparing this translation is to faithfully update the American Standard Version of Mark into contemporary spoken American English as used by those who don't already know anything of the Bible, have no theology background, and are generally unfamiliar with church culture.  

If you do not have a technical background in Bible translation and are still interested, read on.  I will do my best to remain understandable for you too but some of the following will necessarily use scholarly language in order to communicate as clearly as possible with scholars.

### More technically...

*The Beginning of Life* is an updated translation of the book of Mark.  It is a direct derivative work of the *American Standard Version* and the *[World English Bible](https://worldenglish.bible)* (WEB) translations of the Bible.  The WEB is itself a partial update of the American Standard Version translation.

### Overall principles of translation

In preparing this translation, I have drawn on the underlying Greek and/or Hebrew, the rest of the Bible, other modern English translations of the Bible, and scholarly input.

The translation is heavily biased toward formal equivalance in vocabulary, resorting to dynamic equivalence when necessary.  When dynamic equivalence is used to translate a technical term, the formal equivalent and/or traditional translation is preserved as a side note next to the text.  I have used this and other typographical conventions to help with readability while maintaining accuracy.

Formally-equivalent word orderings are preferred but this is heavily in tension with this work's readability goals.  I have included detailed explanations about various ways I resolve this tension below.

### Typographical conventions

Here is an exhaustive list of these conventions: (sn "These owe a great debt to the work of [Edward Tufte](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)")

Here is some text(sn "This is a study note with context helpful for understanding the text.") that might benefit from additional context.

(theme "A theme from this thing.")Describes what happens in the text immediately following.  Typeset as a header (in a lighter typeface than the text).

(tn "Translation note.")Traditional, alternative, or more literal ways to translate a word or phrase. (Avoids textual criticism because of the audience.)  Used especially when the translation resorts to dynamic equivalence in order to keep itself honest.

(vs 1)Verse 1, etc.

Cross reference,(xr "Jhn 1:1-14") hyperlinked to the NLT translation on *bible.com*.  Used to:

  * Link to Old Testament passages when they are quoted or alluded to.
  * Link to other Bible passages that further explain what Mark is saying and/or offer context regarding the current topic in the text.

#### Typographical challenges

The underlying text is maintained in plain text files using an extended Markdown-derived markup language.  

Currently the only drawback of this format is that it offers no way to properly typeset poetry, render "acolon" and "bcolon" lines, etc.  These are currently typeset as a blockquote using line breaks to separate poetry sections from each other.

### Principles of English style

This work seeks to render Mark's gospel in modern spoken English in a colloquial and yet reverent style.  Here are some examples of what this means to this author:

* Shorter sentences, fragments.
* It’s okay to start a sentence with a connector.
* And contractions are okay too.

I am currently targeting a 9th or 10th grade (US) reading level.

#### Word ordering and formal vs. dynamic equivalence

At best, Greek word ordering is bad English style to native English speakers and is confusing to understand at worst. This reworking should respect principles of excellent English style while retaining the academic rigor present in the original ASV text.

The result should be immediately understandable by unchurched or lightly-churched individuals without eliminating challenges faced by all faithful interpreters of the Bible. 

Offensive or confusing things Jesus said and did are retained and not explained. Metaphors that Jesus or Mark used are retained because these add depth and dimension to their context that otherwise would be lost.  Also, many symbols and metaphors appear in a remarkably consistent way throughout the Bible so this author believes that retaining the symbols and metaphors is important to developing a cohesive understanding of the entire Bible.

### Detailed notes on formal versus dynamic equivalence

The ASV is a formal equivalence translation. Retain this rigor in the update within the structure of what would be considered excellent (if colloquial, spoken) English style. On the other hand, all translation work necessarily has an element of interpretation--particularly when a word in the source language does not have a direct equivalent in the target language. In these situations, switch to dynamic equivalence while remaining as close to formal equivalence as possible.

These goals can be in tension with each other. The following principles guide how I have resolved these tensions. I’ve included specific examples where needed to clearly explain a thought.

* Don’t change the meaning; simply update the style of English to the goals above.
* Retain Mark’s "overuse" of the word "immediately". It is this author’s belief that Mark is intentionally using repetition to make a point.
* When a global mechanical search-and-replace update works, use it to retain continuity with the underlying Greek when possible. For example: *Behold* → *Look!*, *wilderness* → *desert*, *multitude* → *large crowd; great multitude → very large crowd.*, etc.
* When appropriate, change to active voice. For example, in 1:26: "The unclean spirit convulsed the man, shrieked loudly, and came out of him."
* Simplify wording of lists to modern spoken English standards. 1:26 above is an example of this.
* A single thought gets a single sentence. Closely-related thoughts or those utilizing parallelism get a single sentence with semicolons separating each thought.
* Break up excessively long sentances.  But be careful to retain relative emphasis among thoughts present in the original.
* Used sparingly, sometimes sentance fragments can be effective as long as they don't change the relative emphasis between the idea in the fragment and the run-on sentance being broken up.
* Many times the English is confusing because Mark used pronouns excessively or the referent of an expression is unclear without carefully studying the grammar of the context. While this may be the way Mark wrote, this is not considered high-quality spoken or written English. Resolve pronouns and other referents to their antecedents when doing this yields a clearer and equally-accurate reading.
* Use parentheses and hyphens (as appropriate) when a thought is interrupted by another one. Prefer using punctuation over rearranging word order.
* Rearrange word order only judiciously and being careful to preserve the emphases each individual idea in a sentence receives.
* If a direct or indirect object is separated from its referent, rearrange the word order to bring them together.
* For example, 2:14: As he passed by the tax office, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus working there. Here the ASV (and the Greek) separates "passed by" from its indirect object "the tax office" with an interjection about Jesus meeting Levi there. Putting the IO next to its verb makes the sentence immediately more comprehensible to a modern reader and also clarifies the fact that Levi was a tax collector.  This also clarifies the following story beginning in verse 18, without adding or removing from what was said.
* Don’t translate symbols or metaphors. The Bible expects a lot of its reader and that’s ok.  See above.
* If a thing would be obvious to one of Mark’s original readers but not to a modern reader, clarify it using rewording, a parenthetical comment, hyphens, etc.  Add a sidenote to preserve accountability.
* Translate technical theological terms whenever necessary for comprehension among today’s largely-unchurched youth.
* Start with the Greek literal translation.  Sometimes this directly offers an excellent substitute.  For example in 1:4, *baptize* → *ceremonially immerse [in water]*.
* Consider the immediate context.  For example, Mark uses the word *baptize* in two ways: the ceremonial way described above and also when *preaching baptism [of repentance for the forgiveness of sins]*.  This latter case can borrow from the context immediately preceeding combined with appropriate translation sidenotes: *need to immerse their affections(tn "a baptism") in God's straight paths instead of their own(tn "of repentance").*  See below for more examples.
* Consider the weight of Scripture.  Sometimes another scripture provides an excellent explanation or definition.  Continuing in verse 4, "a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness *of sins."*  Here "sins" is used in general sense, so we need a concise, faithful expression describing "sin" in the general sense.  Here we can still let Scripture interpret Scripture by rendering this as "forgiven for *preferring selfish pleasure (and the hurt that this causes) instead"* along with a cross-reference to *James 4:1-3* from where this idea was directly lifted.

### More discussion about translating technical theological terms

Repent / repentance: These words aren’t used at all in modern spoken English and especially not among our unchurched youth.

Sin: In colloquial English, this word simply means "a bad thing" or "a bad person". But in common use today when the word is used at all it is frequently used in an ironic or sarcastic way. The effect is to change "sin" from an undesirable to a desirable thing—and sometimes even makes fun of the whole concept of sin to begin with.

Theologically this is beyond inaccurate. Further, we would rarely-to-never refer to someone as a "sinner" in spoken English in the Bible sense of the word outside a church (or even inside most churches). As a result, this author believes the word "sin" has completely lost its meaning in spoken English.

Other concerns happen because different parts of languages change differently over time so some English words' meaning may still be largely faithful but need elaboration or careful adjustment.

In some of these cases I have felt it more appropriate to include the theological term used in the text, but with a (usually parenthetical) elaboration or explanation in the context.  (tn "Sometimes I've used a sidenote to clarify the original authorial intent when retaining a traditional rendering.")

In other cases, I have found that an English word that is closely related to or derived from the original word that hasn’t yet lost its Bible meaning and connotation.

For example, our culture’s understanding of *faith* is more-or-less accurate--but only if one disregards that atheists and many scientists believe that faith is fundamentally an irrational or unscientific thing.

Consequently, I believe that perhaps the word *faith* itself may not be wise to use in a modern English translation.  However, in common use words derived from *faith* remain *faithful* to the Bible meaning, and in many cases we can *faithfully* use those to substitute for and/or to clarify in situations where *faith* is called for.
