title: Chapter 3
excerpt: '“Does the law intend for a person to do good to others or to harm others on the Sabbath day? To save a life or to kill?” Jesus asked.  But his enemies were silent.'
---

(vs 1)Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there whose hand was withered.  (vs 2)Jesus's religious enemies watched to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day so they could accuse him.

(vs 3)Jesus said to the man whose hand was withered, “Stand up.”  (vs 4)Then Jesus addressed his enemies.

“Does the law intend for a person to do good to others or to harm others on the Sabbath day? To save a life or to kill?” Jesus asked.

But his enemies were silent.

(vs 5)Jesus looked around at them with anger (out of grief because his enemies' hearts were becoming harder and harder), then said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” The man stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.

(vs 6)The Pharisees(tn "The religious conservatives of Jesus's day") left and immediately conspired against Jesus with the “Pro King Herod“ political party; together they began planning to kill him.

(theme "The followers, the disciples, and the twelve")
(vs 7)Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples and a huge crowd followed him from Galilee, from Judea, (vs 8)from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, from beyond the Jordan, and from the area around Tyre and Sidon. When he arrived, an enormous crowd gathered made up of who had heard about the amazing things he was doing.

(vs 9)Jesus asked his disciples to keep a little boat nearby because of the crowd pressing toward him.  (vs 10)For he had healed many, and those who had diseases pressed toward him, trying to touch him.  (vs 11)The evil spirits (whenever they saw Jesus) fell down before him shouting, “You are the Son of God!”  (vs 12)But Jesus sternly warned them not to tell people who he was.

(vs 13)Jesus climbed a mountain and called to those he wanted.  And they came.(sn "From the context this appears to be a larger group than the twelve; see Mark 4:10")

(vs 14)He appointed twelve, (that they might be close to him, that he might send them out to preach, (vs 15)and that they would have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons):  (vs 16)Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;  (vs 17)James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder);  (vs 18)Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;  (vs 19)and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

(theme "Those outside and those inside")
Then Jesus came home.  (vs 20)The great crowd came together again, so that those inside could not eat bread.  (vs 21)When Jesus's friends heard the news they came to take custody of him; they said, “He is insane.”  (vs 22)The religious leaders who were scribes from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the ruler of the demons he casts out demons.”

(vs 23) Jesus called for them.  Using word-pictures to illustrate his point(tn "Lit: parables") he asked, “How can Satan cast out Satan?  (vs 24)If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.  (vs 25)If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.  (vs 26)If Satan rebels against himself and is divided he can't stand. He is finished.  (vs 27)Nobody can enter the strong man's house and ransack it unless he first ties up the strong man; then he can ransack his house.

(vs 28)“I say with certainty: all of peoples' sins will be forgiven, including flagrant disrespect with which they may defame God.  (vs 29)But whoever deliberately defames and slanders actions performed by the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness; their guilt never ends.”  (vs 30)—because they said, “He is possessed by a demon.”

(vs 31) The mother and brothers of Jesus came.  Standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.  (vs 32)A great crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Look! your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you.”  (vs 33)He answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”  (vs 34)Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, “Look! my mother and my brothers!  (vs 35)For whoever does the will of God is my brother, my sister, and mother.”
