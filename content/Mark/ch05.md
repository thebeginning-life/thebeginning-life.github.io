(theme "...But evil cannot conquer those who fully trust God")
(vs 1)They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.

(vs 2)When Jesus left the boat, immediately a man with an evil(tn "Lit: unclean") spirit ran from the tombs to meet him.  (vs 3)This man lived in the tombs.(tn "or: the burial caves")

Nobody could tie or restrain him any more--not even using chains!  (vs 4)The people around frequently bound him using shackles and chains, but he tore the chains apart and broke the shackles in pieces. Nobody had the strength to subdue him!

(vs 5)All night, all day he wandered among the the burial caves and the mountains; day and night he shrieked and cut himself with sharp stones.

(vs 6)When he saw Jesus from far away, he ran and bowed low to him.  (vs 7)He roared, "What do I have to do with you--Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I command you by God, don’t torture me!"

(vs 8)(Jesus had already said, "Come out of the man, you evil(tn "Lit: unclean") spirit!")

(vs 9)Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"

He said to Jesus, "My name is Legion, for we are many."  (vs 10)And he begged Jesus over and over not to send them away--out of the country.

(vs 11)Now on the mountainside there was a very large herd of pigs feeding.  (vs 12)All the demons begged Jesus, "Send us into the pigs!  Allow us to enter them!"

(vs 13)Jesus gave them permission.

Then the evil(tn "Lit: unclean") spirits came out of the man, entered the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand pigs rushed down the steep hillside into the sea where they drowned!

(vs 14)Those who fed the pigs fled, spreading the news in the city and in the country!  And the people came to see what had happened.

(theme "The crowd did not understand who Jesus is...")
(vs 15)The people came to Jesus, saw the man who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind--yes even this man who had the legion of evil spirits--and they were afraid.  (vs 16)The eyewitnesses explained to the crowd what happened--to the man who had been demon-possessed and to the pigs.

(vs 17)Then the crowd begged Jesus to leave their region.

(theme "...But the man who was delivered from the devils' oppression did")
(vs 18)As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged Jesus to join him so he could be with him.

(vs 19)Jesus didn’t allow him but replied, "Go to your house, go to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you."  (vs 20)The man went his way, and began to proclaim in the ten towns of the region (tn "Lit. the "region-of-ten-cities" east of the Jordan River") how Jesus had done great things for him.  And everyone was amazed.

(theme "A synagogue ruler trusts Jesus' ability to heal")
(vs 21)When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a huge crowd joined Jesus by the sea.

(vs 22)And look!  a synagogue ruler named Jairus arrived.

When he found Jesus he fell at Jesus's feet. (vs 23)Over and over he begged, "My little daughter is about to die!  Please come; please reach out; please touch her with your hands; please do this so she may become healthy again and live!"(tn "'reach out' added for clarity")

(vs 24)Jesus went with Jairus.  A very large crowd followed--pressing in on Jesus from all sides.

(vs 25)A particular woman in the crowd had blood oozing from her body for twelve years.  (vs 26)She had suffered through many attempts to heal her by many physicians.  She had spent all her money and hadn't gotten any better; instead her symptoms grew worse.

(vs 27)But hearing the reports about Jesus, she worked her way through the crowd behind Jesus and touched his clothes.

(vs 28)She had said, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be well again!"

(vs 29)Immediately the blood stopped flowing from her body and she realized that that her body was healed from her sickness!

(vs 30)Immediately Jesus knew that mighty power had gone out from him so he turned around in the jostling crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"

(vs 31)His disciples asked, "You see this large crowd pressing against you? And you say, ‘Who touched me?’"

(vs 32)Jesus looked around him, trying to see the woman who had done this.

(vs 33)The woman was realizing what had happened to her.  Afraid and trembling, she came to Jesus, fell down in front of him, and told him the whole truth.

(vs 34)Jesus replied, "Daughter, your faith has made you well.  Go in peace, be wholly well--your scourge is gone."

(vs 35)While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house, saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?"

(vs 36)But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Don’t be afraid, only believe."

(vs 37)He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.  (vs 38)He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.  (vs 39)When he had entered in, he said to them, "Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep."

(vs 40)They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.  (vs 41)Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, "Talitha cumi!" which means, being interpreted, "Girl, I tell you, get up!"

(vs 42)Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.  (vs 43)He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.
