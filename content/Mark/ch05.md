# # Chapter 5.

(vs 1)They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.  

(vs 2)When Jesus left the boat, immediately a man with an evil(tn "Lit: unclean") spirit ran from the tombs to meet him.  (vs 3)This man lived in the tombs.(tn "or: the burial caves")

Nobody could tie or restrain him any more--not even using chains!  (vs 4)The people around frequently bound him using shackles and chains, but he tore the chains apart and broke the shackles in pieces. Nobody had the strength to subdue him!  

(vs 5)All night, all day he wandered among the the burial caves and the mountains; day and night he shrieked and cut himself with sharp stones.

(vs 6)When he saw Jesus from far away, he ran and bowed low to him.  (vs 7)He roared, “What do I have to do with you--Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I command you by God, don’t torture me!”  

(vs 8)(Jesus had already said, “Come out of the man, you evil(tn "Lit: unclean") spirit!”)

(vs 9)Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” 

He said to Jesus, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”  (vs 10)And he begged Jesus over and over not to send them away--out of the country.  

(vs 11)Now on the mountainside there was a very large herd of pigs feeding.  (vs 12)All the demons begged Jesus, “Send us into the pigs!  Allow us to enter them!”  

(vs 13)Jesus gave them permission. 

Then the evil(tn "Lit: unclean") spirits came out of the man, entered the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand pigs rushed down the steep hillside into the sea where they drowned!  

(vs 14)Those who fed the pigs fled, spreading the news in the city and in the country!  And the people came to see what had happened.

(vs 15)The people came to Jesus, saw the man who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind--yes even this man who had the legion of evil spirits--and they were afraid.  (vs 16)The eyewitnesses explained to the crowd what happened--to the man who had been demon-possessed and to the pigs.  

(vs 17)Then the crowd begged Jesus to leave their region.  

(vs 18)As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.  

(vs 19)He didn’t allow him, but said to him, “Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you.”  (vs 20)He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis (tn: the “region-of-ten-cities” east of the Jordan River) how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone was amazed.  

(vs 21)When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great great crowd was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.  (vs 22)Look! one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet  (vs 23)and begged him much, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”  

(vs 24)He went with him, and a great great crowd followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.  

(vs 25)A certain woman who had a discharge of blood for twelve years,  (vs 26)and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,  

(vs 27)having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes.  (vs 28)For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.”  

(vs 29)Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.  

(vs 30)Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”  

(vs 31)His disciples said to him, “You see the great crowd pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”  

(vs 32)He looked around to see her who had done this thing.  

(vs 33)But the woman, afraid and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.  (vs 34)He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”  

(vs 35)While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house, saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”  

(vs 36)But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Don’t be afraid, only believe.”  

(vs 37)He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.  (vs 38)He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.  (vs 39)When he had entered in, he said to them, “Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”  

(vs 40)They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.  (vs 41)Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, “Talitha cumi!” which means, being interpreted, “Girl, I tell you, get up!”  

(vs 42)Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.  (vs 43)He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.
