(theme "Jesus heals *and forgives* a man who spares no cost to come to him")
(vs 1)A number of days later Jesus returned to Capernaum and the news quickly spread that he was at home.  (vs 2)Immediately a crowd gathered and soon there was no more room, not even around the door.  And Jesus spoke the word to them.

(vs 3)Four people came, carrying a paralyzed man to Jesus.  (vs 4)When they couldn’t get close to Jesus because of the crowd, they broke up and removed the roof above Jesus! Then (with the roof removed), they lowered the mat where the paralyzed man was lying.

(vs 5)Jesus, recognizing their reasonable expectation that he could and would help,(tn "faith")(xr "Hebrews 11:1") said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your selfish tendencies and choices(tn "sins") are forgiven.”

(vs 6)But some of the religious experts (who were scribes) were sitting there reasoning silently in their hearts:

(vs 7)“Why does this man defame and insult God like that?  It’s blasphemy!  Who can forgive all of another person's selfish tendencies and choices(tn "sins") but God alone?” they thought to themselves.

(vs 8)Immediately Jesus perceived in his spirit that they reasoned this way and said to them, “Why do you question and criticize?  (vs 9)Which is easier to tell a paralyzed person:  ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or, ‘Get up, pick up your bed, and walk?’  (vs 10)But to demonstrate that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—” (Jesus then spoke to the paralyzed man) (vs 11)“—Get up, pick up up your mat, and return home.”

(vs 12)The man got up, immediately picked up his mat, and went out in front of them all! Everyone was amazed and glorified God. “We have never seen anything like this!” they said.

(theme "Jesus is close to people who recognize their own need")
(vs 13)Jesus returned to the seashore; a very large crowd came together, and Jesus taught them.  (vs 14)As he passed the tax office, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus working there. “Follow me,” Jesus said. And Levi got up and followed him.

(vs 15)Later, Jesus was reclining at the meal table in Levi’s house, and many other tax collectors and socially unacceptable “sinners” sat down with Jesus and his disciples; there were many of these kinds of people, and they followed Jesus.  (vs 16)But the religious experts who were scribes and religious conservatives known as Pharisees (when they saw Jesus eating with the “sinners” and tax collectors) questioned his disciples.

“Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and ‘sinners’?” these religious teachers asked.

(vs 17)Jesus overheard this and replied, “Those who are healthy don’t need a doctor, but sick people do. I didn’t come to call people who think they already do everything right(tn "the 'righteous', but Jesus is being sarcastic"), but people who prefer pursuing selfish pleasure(tn "sinners") to recognize the hurt that this choice causes and to have a deep change of heart(tn "to repentance").”

(theme"Religious tradition can't offer a close relationship with Jesus")
(vs 18)John’s disciples and some Pharisees, the religious conservatives, were fasting by temporarily going without something to instead focus more clearly on God. They came to Jesus and questioned, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”

(vs 19)Jesus answered, "Can the honored groomsmen at a wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them?  As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast.  (vs 20)But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and beginning that day they will fast.

(vs 21)"Nobody patches an old shrunken piece of clothes using new fabric that hasn't shrunk yet. Otherwise when the new patch shrinks, it will tear away from the old cloth, and a worse hole will be made.  (vs 22)No one puts new wine into old, brittle wine-skins. If they did, when the new wine ferments and expands, it would cause the old skins to burst, the wine to pour out, and the skins to be destroyed. Instead, they put new wine into fresh wine-skins.”

(vs 23)On the Sabbath day Jesus and his disciples were going through some grain fields and his disciples began to pick some ears of grain to eat.  (vs 24)The Pharisees said to him, “Look! why do they do what is against (traditional religious) law on the Sabbath day?”

(vs 25)Jesus replied, “Didn’t you ever read what David did when he was needy, when he was hungry?  He, along with those who were with him?  (vs 26)Do you remember how David entered God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the ceremonial show bread? And do you remember how it is against the Law of Moses for anyone to eat the temple bread except for the priests--but David ate it and gave some to those who were with him too?”  (vs 27)Jesus said to them, “The special Sabbath day was made to meet people's needs, not men and women for the Sabbath.  (vs 28)Therefore the Son of Man is the ruler, even over the Sabbath!”
