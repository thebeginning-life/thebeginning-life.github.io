(theme "The teaching to understand all the other teachings")
(vs 1)Jesus returned to the seaside to teach.  A huge crowd gathered, so Jesus got into a boat in the water and sat down; the crowd listened from the land nearby.

(vs 2)Jesus taught the crowd many things using word-pictures as illustrations.  While Jesus was teaching, he urgently said:

> (vs 3)Carefully think about these things!(tn "Or spoke saying 'Listen!  Look! ...")
>
> A farmer went out to plant.  (vs 4)As he spread his seeds, some fell by the road and the birds came and devoured them.  
>
> (vs 5)Other seeds fell on the rocky ground where there was little soil.  Immediately plants sprang up (because the soil wasn't deep) but (vs 6)when the sun rose it scorched the seed--because the seed's roots had no depth the plants withered away.  
>
> (vs 7)Other seeds fell among the thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them; they didn't yield any fruit.  
>
> (vs 8)Other seeds fell into good soil, grew to maturity, and yielded fruit.  Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much as was originally planted.
>
> (vs 9)If anyone's heart is open(tn "Lit: If anyone has 'ears to hear'...") must carefully take this to heart!

(theme "Jesus explains his illustration for those who persistently stay close to him")
(vs 10)Later, when Jesus was separate from the crowds(tn "The Greek translated here 'separate from the crowds' can also be translated 'alone'.") those who were around him (along with the twelve) asked him to explain this illustration.

(vs 11)Jesus replied, "I am giving you(tn "or: trusting you with") the mysteries of God’s Kingdom, but I only offer word pictures to those who are outside.(tn "the second phrase 'God's Kingdom' is implied from the context")  (vs 12)This is so that 

>While seeing they may "see" but not perceive,(xr "Jer 5:21-29")(xr "Ezk 12:2-3")
>
>And while hearing they may "hear" and not understand; 
>
>Otherwise they might turn around,
>
>And their selfish preferences and choices be forgiven."

(vs 13)Jesus continued, "Don’t you understand this word picture? If not, how will you understand all the other illustrations?  

(theme "The Word is beyond value and things that detract from it are destructive")
(vs 14)The farmer spreads the Word.(sn "In Jesus's day farmers scattered seeds across the ground, which is why--as described here--it would be normal for some seed to land elsewhere than in the field.")

(vs 15)Those by the road are in one place the Word lands.(tn "Or more loosely: the Word lands all over--even by the road!")  But when they have heard the Word, immediately Satan comes and takes the Word that the farmer planted in their hearts.  

(vs 16)In the same way, some seed lands in shallow rocky soil.  When these people have heard the Word they immediately receive it with joy, (vs 17)but they have no root in themselves and live only for a short time.  When they begin to experience trouble or hostility from receiving the Word, immediately they are scandalized and fall.

(vs 18)Others seeds fall among thorns.  When people who are like thorny soil have heard the Word (vs 19)the world's distractions, the mirage of being satisfied by money, and forbidden desires come in.  These compete against and choke out the Word.  And it becomes unfruitful.

(vs 20)And there is seed that falls on the good ground.  People like this hear the Word, accept it, and bear fruit.  Some multiply the Word thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times beyond what they received."

(theme "An oil lamp's purpose is to illuminate things")
(vs 21)Jesus continued, "Is an oil lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a stand?(sn "A basket's purpose is to help with human labor; a bed's purpose is to aid our rest.  The light doesn't belong beneath either, but in its own rightful place.")

(vs 22)"Nothing is hidden except for it to be discovered, and every secret is intended to be illuminated.

(vs 23)"If anyone's heart is open, he or she should carefully take this to heart!"(tn "Lit: If anyone has 'ears to hear'...")

(theme "Value it, use it, and be rewarded with more--otherwise lose it")
(vs 24)Jesus said, "Pay careful attention to what you hear.  Whatever metric you use to measure what you apply to your life will be used to measure more back to you--and those who pay careful attention to what they hear will receive even more.

(vs 25)Whoever makes what they hear part of themselves will be given more.  But the person who ignores what they hear,(tn "so it's as if they don't know it at all") even what that person genuinely has will be taken away." 

(theme "Metaphors that illustrate God's Kingdom")
(vs 26)Jesus said, "God’s Kingdom is like a man spreading seed on the earth.  (vs 27)The man sleeps and wakes night and day and the seed germinates and grows--even though the man doesn’t fully understand how.  (vs 28)The earth produces fruit by itself: first the blade, then the ear, then the mature grain in the ear.  (vs 29)But when the fruit is ripe, immediately the farmer cuts the stalks down using his sickle--because the harvest has arrived."

(vs 30)Jesus continued, "What is God’s Kingdom like?  What metaphor illustrates it well?  

(vs 31)"God's Kingdom is like a single mustard seed.  When it's planted in the earth--even though it's the smallest seed (vs 32)when it is planted it matures into a larger plant than the other garden plants.  It grows large branches and birds from high places(tn "Lit: of the heavens") nest in its shade."

(vs 33)Jesus used many similar word-pictures to explain the Word, up to the amount they could hear.

(vs 34)Jesus no longer spoke to the crowd except through illustrations--but he explained everything privately to his students.

(theme "The students try to cross the sea using their own strength")
(vs 35)That evening Jesus said, "Let’s go to the other side of the sea."  (vs 36)Leaving the huge crowd, the students took Jesus with them and got into the boat; other small boats joined.  

(vs 37)A large wind-storm rose and the waves beat into the boat--so badly that the boat was nearly swamped!

(vs 38)Jesus was in the back of the boat, asleep on a cushion!  The students woke him up demanding, "Teacher! don’t you care that we are dying?"

(vs 39)Jesus woke up and corrected the wind!  He commanded the sea, "Silence!  Be still!"  The wind suddenly stopped and a great calm came over the sea!

(vs 40)Jesus asked the students, "Why are you so afraid?  How is it that you have no faith?"  (vs 41)They were deeply frightened and asked each other, "Who is this?  Even the wind and the sea obey him!"
