(theme "Jesus explains the mysteries of God to those in his Kingdom")
(vs 1)Jesus returned to the seaside to teach.  A huge crowd gathered, so Jesus got into a boat in the water and sat down; the crowd remained on the land nearby.

(vs 2)Jesus taught the crowd many things using word pictures.  While Jesus was teaching, he urgently said:(tn "Or spoke saying 'Listen!  Look! ...")

> (vs 3)Carefully notice these things:
>
> A farmer went out to plant.  (vs 4)As he spread his seeds, some fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.  
>
> (vs 5)Other seeds fell on the rocky ground where it had little soil.  Immediately plants sprang up (because the soil wasn't deep) but (vs 6)when the sun rose it scorched the seed--because the seed's roots had no depth the plants withered away.  
>
> (vs 7)Other seeds fell among the thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them; they didn't yield any fruit.  
>
> (vs 8)Other seeds fell into good soil, grew to maturity, and yielded fruit.  Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much as was originally planted.
>
> (vs 9)Everyone who has "ears to hear" must carefully take this to heart!

(vs 10)Later, when Jesus was alone, those who were around him (along with the twelve) asked him to explain this word picture.

(vs 11)Jesus replied, "I am giving you(tn "or: trusting you with") the mysteries of God’s Kingdom, but I only offer word pictures to those who are outside God's Kingdom(tn "the second phrase 'God's Kingdom' is implied from the context").  (vs 12)This is so that 

>While seeing they may "see" but not perceive,(xr "Jer 5:21-29")(xr "Ezk 12:2-3")
>
>And while hearing they may "hear" and not understand; 
>
>Otherwise they might turn around,
>
>And their selfish preferences and choices be forgiven."

(vs 13)Jesus continued, "Don’t you understand this word picture? If not, how will you understand all the other word pictures?  

(theme "The Word is beyond value and things that detract from it are destructive")
(vs 14)The farmer spreads the Word.(sn "In Jesus's day farmers scattered seeds across the ground, which is why--as described here--it would be normal for some seed to land elsewhere than in the field.")

(vs 15)Those by the road are in one place the Word lands.(tn "Or more loosely: the Word lands all over--even by the road!")  But when they have heard the Word, immediately Satan comes and takes the Word that the farmer planted in their hearts.  

(vs 16)In the same way, some seed lands in shallow soil with rocks just below the surface.  When these people have heard the word they immediately receive it with joy, (vs 17)but they have no root in themselves and live only for a short time.  When they begin to experience trouble or hostility from receiving the Word, immediately they are scandalized and fall.

(vs 18)Others seeds fall among thorns.  When people who are like thorny soil have heard the Word (vs 19)the world's distractions, the mirage of being satisfied by money, and forbidden desires come in.  These compete against and choke out the Word.  And it becomes unfruitful.

(vs 20)And there is seed that falls on the good ground.  People like this hear the Word, accept it, and bear fruit.  Some multiply the Word thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times beyond what they received."(sn "These numbers represent impossible agricultural yields, but God is in the miracle business.  Also, these numbers appear other places in the Bible and have significance on their own.")

(theme "Obtain a lamp in order to bring secrets to light")
(vs 21)Jesus continued, "Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a stand?  

(vs 22)Nothing is hidden except for it to be discovered, and every secret is intended to be illuminated.

(vs 23)If anyone has "ears to hear," he should carefully take this to heart!"  

(vs 24)He said to them, "Pay careful attention to what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you; and more will be given to you who hear.  (vs 25)For whoever has, to him more will be given; and he who doesn’t have, even what he has will be taken away from him."  (vs 26)He said, "God’s Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,  (vs 27)and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, though he doesn’t know how.  (vs 28)For the earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.  (vs 29)But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come."  (vs 30)He said, "How will we liken God’s Kingdom? Or with what object lesson will we illustrate it?  (vs 31)It’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,  (vs 32)yet when it is sown, grows up and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow."  (vs 33)With many such object lessons he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.  (vs 34)Without a object lesson he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.  (vs 35)On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let’s go over to the other side."  (vs 36)Leaving the great crowd, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.  (vs 37)A big wind-storm rose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was nearly swamped.  (vs 38)He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and asked him, "Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?"  (vs 39)He awoke and reprimanded the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" The wind abruptly stopped and there was a great calm.  (vs 40)He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?"  (vs 41)They were greatly afraid and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?" ﻿
