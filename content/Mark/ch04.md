(theme "The teaching to understand all the other teachings")
(vs 1)Jesus returned to the seaside to teach.  A huge crowd gathered, so Jesus got into a boat in the water and sat down; the crowd listened from the land nearby.(sn "In addition to keeping Jesus safe from the press of the crowds, being in a boat on the water made it possible for Jesus to project his voice to the largest number of people possible because sound travels long distances over water.")

(vs 2)Jesus taught the crowd many things using word-pictures as illustrations.  Speaking urgently, Jesus began to teach:

(vs 3)"Carefully think about these things!"(tn "Lit: spoke saying 'Listen!  Look! ...")

"A farmer went out to plant."

* (vs 4)"As he spread his seeds some fell next to the road; the birds came and ate them.

* (vs 5)"Other seeds fell on rocky ground where there was little soil.  Immediately plants sprang up (because the soil wasn't deep) but (vs 6)when the sun rose it scorched the seed.  Because the seed's roots had no depth the plants withered away.

* (vs 7)"Other seeds fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them; they didn't yield any fruit.

* (vs 8)"Other seeds fell into good soil, grew to maturity, and yielded fruit.  Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much as was originally planted.

 (vs 9)"If anyone's heart is open to hear, that person must carefully listen and take this to heart!"(tn "Lit: If anyone has 'ears to hear' let him hear")

(theme "Jesus explains his illustrations to those who persistently stay close to him")
(vs 10)Later--after the crowds left Jesus alone--those who were still around (along with the twelve) asked him to explain this illustration.

(vs 11)Jesus replied, "I'm giving you the mysteries of Godâ€™s Kingdom; I offer illustrations without explanations to those who are outside it.(tn "the phrase 'of God's Kingdom' is implied from the context")  (vs 12)This is so that

>*While seeing they may "see" but not perceive,*(xr "Jer 5:21-29")(xr "Ezk 12:2-3")
>
>*And while hearing they may "hear" and not understand;*
>
>*Otherwise they might turn around,*
>
>*And their selfish preferences and choices be forgiven."*

(vs 13)Jesus continued, "Donâ€™t you understand this illustration?(sn "ðŸ”‘ This illustration is the key to understanding the rest of Jesus's teachings--through the entire rest of the Bible and in our own lives, not just in Mark's book.") If not, how will you understand all the other ones?"

(theme "The Word is beyond value and everything that detracts from it is destructive")
(vs 14)"The farmer spreads the Word."(tn "In Jesus's day farmers scattered seeds across the ground, which is why--as described here--it would be normal for some of the seed to land elsewhere than in the field.")

* (vs 15)The first are people who are beside the road where the word is spread!  When they hear the Word, immediately Satan comes and takes the Word that the farmer planted in them.(tn "Te Greek here reads 'the first are people beside the road'--a metaphor, not a simile.  Jesus is using very strong language!")

* (vs 16)The next seeds landed on shallow rocky soil.  When people are shallow rocky soil and hear the Word they immediately receive it with delight!  (vs 17)But the Word's roots cannot grow deep in their hearts and they only live a short time.  When they begin to experience trouble or hostility because they received the Word, immediately they are bitterly offended and leave!

* (vs 18)Other seeds land among thorns.  When people are thorny soil, they hear the Word--but other things in their lives present themselves as alternatives to the Word.  (vs 19)The world's distractions, the mirage of being satisfied by material things,(tn "or: deceitfulness of wealth") and passionate preoccupations toward forbidden or good things crowd out the Word and cause it to be unfruitful!

* (vs 20)But there is seed that lands on good ground.(sn "ðŸ”‘ We all start out as unfruitful soil, so is there hope?  Yes!  If we are willing to be broken by the farmer's plow; to give the farmer the hard and unyielding things in our lives; to allow the farmer to pull out all the unhealthy things that distract us and to thin away the good things in our lives that have overgrown our hearts.  This is the secret to understanding the rest of Jesus's teachings: for the Word's roots to have unimpeded access to our hearts.")  These people hear the Word, accept it, and are fertile soil bearing fruit.  Some of these people multiply the Word thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times beyond what they received!"

(theme "It's God's privilege to conceal things and the king's privilege to discover them")
(vs 21)Jesus continued, "Is an oil lamp brought to a place in order to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isnâ€™t it put on a stand?(sn "A basket's purpose is to help with human labor; a bed's purpose is to aid our rest.  The light doesn't belong beneath either, but in its own rightful place.")

(vs 22)"Nothing is hidden except for it to be discovered, and every secret is intended to be illuminated.(xr "Pro 25:2")

(vs 23)"If anyone's heart is open to hear, that person should carefully listen!"(tn "Lit: If anyone has 'ears to hear'...")

(theme "Value it, use it, and be generously given more--otherwise lose it")
(vs 24)Jesus said, "Pay careful attention to what you hear.  The metric you use to measure what you apply to your life will also be used to measure more back to you--along with a gracious bonus.(tn "Lit: and extra to you.")

(vs 25)Whoever makes what they hear part of themselves will be given more.  But the person who ignores what they hear,(tn "so it's as if they don't know it at all") even what that person genuinely has will be taken away."

(theme "Metaphors that illustrate God's Kingdom")
(vs 26)Jesus said, "Godâ€™s Kingdom is like a man spreading seed on the earth.

(vs 27)"The man sleeps and wakes night and day and the seed germinates and grows--even though the man doesnâ€™t fully understand how.

(vs 28)"The earth produces fruit by itself: first the blade, then the ear, then the mature grain in the ear.

(vs 29)"But when the fruit is ripe, immediately the farmer cuts the stalks down using his sickle--because the harvest has arrived."

(vs 30)Jesus continued, "What is Godâ€™s Kingdom like?  What metaphor illustrates it well?

(vs 31)"God's Kingdom is like a single mustard seed.

"Even though it's the smallest seed (vs 32)at planting time, it grows and matures into a larger plant than the other garden plants.  It grows large branches and birds from high places(tn "Lit: of the heavens") nest in its shade."

(vs 33)Jesus used many similar illustrations to explain the Word, up to the amount they could hear.

(vs 34)Jesus no longer spoke to the crowd except through illustrations!  But he explained everything privately to his students who stayed with him.

(theme "The students try to cross the sea using their own strength")
(vs 35)That evening Jesus said, "Letâ€™s go to the other side of the sea."  (vs 36)Leaving the huge crowd, the students took Jesus with them and got into the boat; other small boats joined.

(vs 37)A large wind-storm rose and the waves broke into the boat--so badly that the boat was nearly swamped!

(vs 38)Jesus was in the back of the boat, asleep on a cushion!

His students woke him up demanding, "Teacher!  Donâ€™t you care that we are dying?"

(vs 39)Jesus woke up and corrected the wind!  He commanded the sea, "Silence!  Be still!"  The wind suddenly stopped and a great calm came over the sea!

(vs 40)Jesus asked the students, "Why are you so afraid?  How is it that you have no faith?"  (vs 41)They were deeply frightened and asked each other, "Who is this?  Even the wind and the sea obey him!"
