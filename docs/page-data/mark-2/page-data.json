As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast.  <small><sup>20</sup></small>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and beginning that day they will fast.</p>\n<p><small><sup>21</sup></small>“Nobody patches an old shrunken piece of clothes using new fabric that hasn’t shrunk yet.

He, along with those who were with him?  <small><sup>26</sup></small>Do you remember how David entered God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the ceremonial show bread? And do you remember how it is against the Law of Moses for anyone to eat the temple bread except for the priests–but David ate it and gave some to those who were with him too?”  </p>\n<p><small><sup>27</sup></small>Jesus said to them, “The special Sabbath day was made to meet people’s needs, not men and women for the Sabbath.  <small><sup>28</sup></small>Therefore the Son of Man<label for=\"md-what-s-son-of-man\" class=\"margin-toggle \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"md-what-s-son-of-man\" class=\"margin-toggle\" /><span class=\"marginnote\">What’s ‘Son of Man’ here?
