Here is how I resolve this dilemma for myself.</p>\n<p>To understand Mark, I believe it is important to keep the following principles in mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mark teaches primarily by example.</li>\n<li>Mark wants us to read ourselves into the stories and to apply any lessons contained in the stories to the degree that they fit in our own lives.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That might sound confusing, so here are two thoughts to get you started.  Mark’s book has two overarching points and basically asks two questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will you be baptized–not just ceremonially, but in your heart also, as described in <a href=\"/Mark-1\">chapter 1</a>.</li>\n<li>Who is Jesus?  What will you do with your understanding of Jesus?  If you could be among Jesus’s listeners, with which group would you identify the most?  What kinds of things does Jesus say to the people you identify with the most?  Is Jesus right about you?  Do you like what this implies about you?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"theme\">Ultimately Mark asks you to consider</span>\nWhat will you change as–by seeing Jesus through Mark’s eyes–you get to know Jesus more and more yourself?</p>\n<p>And: You can’t change as fundamentally as Mark as recommending by trying to do better.  Will you admit this to yourself and to God–and ask God himself to help you to understand and to change?</p>\n<p>Lastly: Are these changes worth it?  Mark, in writing his book, is betting that upon careful consideration you will agree that anything Jesus would want from you is more than worth any possible personal cost.</p>\n<p>I would (along with Mark) invite you to come see for yourself.</p>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"<p><span class=\"theme\">The Beginning</span>\nIn his very first verse Mark offers an astonishing claim: That his book is the <strong>beginning</strong> of the Good News about Jesus, God’s son.</p>\n<p>Yet, a Western reader could easily be forgiven for wondering how Mark’s collection of stories reflects <strong>good news</strong>…</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to understand Mark","cover":"https://unsplash.it/400/300/?random?BigTest","date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["Getting Started","About"],"tags":null},"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-understand-mark","date":"January 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-to-understand-mark","nexttitle":"Mark 1","nextslug":"/mark-1","prevtitle":"Mark 16","prevslug":"/mark-16"}},"staticQueryHashes":["231881711"]}
