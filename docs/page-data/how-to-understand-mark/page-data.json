To understand Mark, I believe it is important to keep the following principles in mind:</p><ol>\n<li>Mark teaches primarily by example.</li>\n<li>Mark wants us to read ourselves into the stories and to apply them to the extent that they fit in our own lives.</li>\n</ol><p>Here is how this works.  Fundamentally, I believe that Mark’s book has two points and asks two questions:</p><ul>\n<li>Will you be baptized–not just ceremonially, but in your heart also, as described in <a href=\"/Mark-1\">chapter 1</a>.</li>\n<li>Who is Jesus?  What will you do with your understanding of Jesus?  If you could be among Jesus’s listeners, with which group would you honestly identify the most?  What kinds of things does Jesus say to the people you identify with the most?  Is Jesus right?  Do you like what this implies about you?</li>\n</ul><p>Ultimately: What will you change as–by seeing Jesus through Mark’s eyes–you get to know Jesus more and more?</p></section>","timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"<section><h2 id=\"the-beginning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-beginning\" aria-label=\"the beginning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Beginning</h2><p>In his very first verse Mark offers an astonishing claim: That his book is the <strong>beginning</strong> of the Good News about Jesus.</p><p>Yet, a Western reader could be easily forgiven for wondering how Mark’s collection of stories reflects <strong>good news</strong>…</p></section>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to understand Mark","cover":"https://unsplash.it/400/300/?random?BigTest","date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["Mark"],"tags":null},"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-understand-mark","date":"January 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-to-understand-mark","nexttitle":"Mark 1","nextslug":"/mark-1","prevtitle":"Mark 16","prevslug":"/mark-16"}},"staticQueryHashes":["231881711"]}
