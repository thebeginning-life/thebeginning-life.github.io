Hosanna in the highest!”  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"11\">11 </sup></small>Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, because it was evening he left Jerusalem and returned to Bethany with the twelve.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"12\">12 </sup></small>The next day, when they had left Bethany’s town boundaries he was hungry.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"13\">13 </sup></small>Seeing a fig tree far away off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"14\">14 </sup></small>Jesus told it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” and his disciples heard it.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"15\">15 </sup></small>They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"16\">16 </sup></small>He would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"17\">17 </sup></small>He taught, saying to them, “Isn’t it written, <em>‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?’</em> But you have made it a den of robbers!”  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"18\">18 </sup></small>The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and searched for how they could destroy him. For they feared him because all the great crowd was amazed at his teaching.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"19\">19 </sup></small>When evening came, he went out of the city.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"20\">20 </sup></small>As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"21\">21 </sup></small>Peter, remembering, said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away.”  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"22\">22 </sup></small>Jesus answered them, “Have expectant trust<label for=\"sd-less-than-em-greater\" class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\"></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"sd-less-than-em-greater\" class=\"margin-toggle\" /><span class=\"sidenote\"><em>faith</em></span> in God.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"23\">23 </sup></small>For most certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and doesn’t doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening, he shall have whatever he says.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"24\">24 </sup></small>Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"25\">25 </sup></small>Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your wrongdoings.  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"26\">26 </sup></small>But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your wrongdoings.”  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"27\">27 </sup></small>They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him,  <small><sup class=\"verse\" id=\"28\">28 </sup></small>and they began saying to him, “By what authority do you do these things?
