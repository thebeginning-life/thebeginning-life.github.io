You do many things like this.”  <small><sup>14</sup></small>He called all the great crowd to himself and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand.  <small><sup>15</sup></small>There is nothing from outside of the man that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.  <small><sup>16</sup></small>If anyone has ears to hear, let him carefully take this to heart!”  <small><sup>17</sup></small>When he had entered into a house away from the great crowd, his disciples asked him about the object lesson.  <small><sup>18</sup></small>He said to them, “Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,  <small><sup>19</sup></small>because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, making all foods clean?”  <small><sup>20</sup></small>He said, “what proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.  <small><sup>21</sup></small>For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,  <small><sup>22</sup></small>greed, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, defaming God, pride, and foolishness.  <small><sup>23</sup></small>All these evil things come from within and defile the man.”  <small><sup>24</sup></small>From there he got up and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.  <small><sup>25</sup></small>For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.  <small><sup>26</sup></small>Now the woman was a Greek gentile, a Syrian-Phoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.  <small><sup>27</sup></small>But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”  <small><sup>28</sup></small>But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”  <small><sup>29</sup></small>He said to her, “Because of this answer, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”  <small><sup>30</sup></small>She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.  <small><sup>31</sup></small>Again he left the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee through the middle of the region of Decapolis (that is, the ten-cities-east-of-Jordan).  <small><sup>32</sup></small>They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.  <small><sup>33</sup></small>He took him aside from the great crowd privately and put his fingers into his ears; and he spat and touched his tongue.  <small><sup>34</sup></small>Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”  <small><sup>35</sup></small>Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.  <small><sup>36</sup></small>He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.  <small><sup>37</sup></small>They were beyond amazed, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!” ﻿</p>","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"1Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.  2Now when they saw some of his disciples…","frontmatter":{"title":"Mark 7","cover":"https://unsplash.it/400/300/?random?BigTest","date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["Mark"],"tags":null},"fields":{"slug":"/mark-7","date":"January 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mark-7","nexttitle":"Mark 6","nextslug":"/mark-6","prevtitle":"Mark 4","prevslug":"/mark-4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1421311927"]}
