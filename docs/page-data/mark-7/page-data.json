You do many things like this.”  <small><sup>14<a name=\"14\"></a></sup></small>He called all the great crowd to himself and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand.  <small><sup>15<a name=\"15\"></a></sup></small>There is nothing from outside of the man that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.  <small><sup>16<a name=\"16\"></a></sup></small>If anyone has ears to hear, let him carefully take this to heart!”  <small><sup>17<a name=\"17\"></a></sup></small>When he had entered into a house away from the great crowd, his disciples asked him about the object lesson.  <small><sup>18<a name=\"18\"></a></sup></small>He said to them, “Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,  <small><sup>19<a name=\"19\"></a></sup></small>because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, making all foods clean?”  <small><sup>20<a name=\"20\"></a></sup></small>He said, “what proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.  <small><sup>21<a name=\"21\"></a></sup></small>For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,  <small><sup>22<a name=\"22\"></a></sup></small>greed, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, defaming God, pride, and foolishness.  <small><sup>23<a name=\"23\"></a></sup></small>All these evil things come from within and defile the man.”  <small><sup>24<a name=\"24\"></a></sup></small>From there he got up and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.  <small><sup>25<a name=\"25\"></a></sup></small>For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.  <small><sup>26<a name=\"26\"></a></sup></small>Now the woman was a Greek gentile, a Syrian-Phoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.  <small><sup>27<a name=\"27\"></a></sup></small>But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”  <small><sup>28<a name=\"28\"></a></sup></small>But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”  <small><sup>29<a name=\"29\"></a></sup></small>He said to her, “Because of this answer, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”  <small><sup>30<a name=\"30\"></a></sup></small>She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.  <small><sup>31<a name=\"31\"></a></sup></small>Again he left the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee through the middle of the region of Decapolis (that is, the ten-cities-east-of-Jordan).  <small><sup>32<a name=\"32\"></a></sup></small>They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.  <small><sup>33<a name=\"33\"></a></sup></small>He took him aside from the great crowd privately and put his fingers into his ears; and he spat and touched his tongue.  <small><sup>34<a name=\"34\"></a></sup></small>Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”  <small><sup>35<a name=\"35\"></a></sup></small>Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.  <small><sup>36<a name=\"36\"></a></sup></small>He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.  <small><sup>37<a name=\"37\"></a></sup></small>They were beyond amazed, saying, “He has done all things well.
