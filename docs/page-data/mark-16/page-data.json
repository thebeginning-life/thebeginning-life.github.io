Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.  <small><sup>5</sup></small>Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed.  <small><sup>6</sup></small>He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him!  <small><sup>7</sup></small>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.’”  <small><sup>8</sup></small>They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.  <small><sup>9</sup></small>Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.  <small><sup>10</sup></small>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.  <small><sup>11</sup></small>When they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.  <small><sup>12</sup></small>After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them as they walked, on their way into the country.  <small><sup>13</sup></small>They went away and told it to the rest. They didn’t believe them, either.  <small><sup>14</sup></small>Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table; and he reprimanded them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t believe those who had seen him after he had risen.  <small><sup>15</sup></small>He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the Good News to the whole creation.  <small><sup>16</sup></small>He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.  <small><sup>17</sup></small>These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;  <small><sup>18</sup></small>they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”  <small><sup>19</sup></small>So then the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.  <small><sup>20</sup></small>They went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.</p>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"1When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, that they might come and anoint him…","frontmatter":{"title":"Mark 16","cover":"https://unsplash.it/400/300/?random?BigTest","date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["Mark"],"tags":null},"fields":{"slug":"/mark-16","date":"January 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mark-16","nexttitle":"Mark 15","nextslug":"/mark-15","prevtitle":"Mark 14","prevslug":"/mark-14"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1421311927"]}
