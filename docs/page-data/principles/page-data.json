Here are some examples of what this means to this author:</p><ul>\n<li>Shorter sentences, fragments.</li>\n<li>It’s okay to start a sentence with a connector.</li>\n<li>And contractions are okay too.</li>\n</ul><p>At best, Greek word ordering is bad English style to native English speakers and is confusing to understand at worst. This reworking should respect principles of excellent English style while retaining the academic rigor present in the original ASV text.</p><p>The result should be immediately understandable by unchurched or lightly-churched individuals without eliminating challenges faced by all faithful interpreters of the Bible. Offensive or confusing things Jesus said and did are retained and not explained. And metaphors that Jesus or Mark used are retained because these add depth and dimension to their context that otherwise would be lost.  Also, many symbols and metaphors appear in a remarkably consistent way throughout the Bible so this author believes that retaining the symbols and metaphors is important to developing an understanding of the entire Bible.</p></section>\n<section><h2 id=\"method\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#method\" aria-label=\"method permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Method</h2><p>Update the American Standard Version’s (ASV) rendering of Mark’s gospel. The ASV is a formal equivalence translation. Retain this rigor in the update within the structure of what would be considered excellent (if colloquial, spoken) English style. On the other hand, all translation work necessarily has an element of interpretation, particularly when a word in the source language does not have a direct equivalent in the target language. This is true even when translating from archaic English into modern spoken English. In these situations, switch to dynamic equivalence while remaining as close to formal equivalence as possible.</p><p>These goals can be in tension with each other. The following principles guide how I have resolved these tensions. I’ve included specific examples where needed to clearly explain a thought.</p><ul>\n<li>Don’t change the meaning; simply update the style of English to the goals above.</li>\n<li>When appropriate, change to active voice. For example, in 1:26: “The unclean spirit convulsed the man, shrieked loudly, and came out of him.”</li>\n<li>Simplify wording of lists to modern spoken English standards. 1:26 above is an example of this.</li>\n<li>A single thought gets a single sentence. Closely-related thoughts or those utilizing parallelism get a single sentence with semicolons separating each thought.</li>\n<li>Many times the English is confusing because Mark used pronouns excessively or the referent of an expression is unclear without carefully studying the grammar of the context. While this may be the way Mark wrote, this is not considered high-quality spoken or written English. Resolve pronouns and other referents to their antecedents when doing this yields a clearer and equally-accurate reading.</li>\n<li>Use parentheses and hyphens (as appropriate) when a thought is interrupted by another one. Prefer using parentheses over rearranging word order.</li>\n<li>Rearrange word order only judiciously and being careful to preserve the emphases each individual idea in a sentence receives.</li>\n<li>If a direct or indirect object is separated from its referent, rearrange the word order to bring them together.</li>\n<li>For example, 2:14: As he passed by the tax office, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus working there. Here the ASV (and presumably the Greek) separates “passed by” from its indirect object “the tax office” with the comment about meeting Levi there. Putting the IO next to its verb makes the sentence immediately more comprehensible to a modern reader and also clarifies the fact that Levi was a tax collector, clarifying the following story beginning in verse 18, without adding or removing from what was said as it was originally rendered in the ASV.</li>\n<li>Don’t translate symbols or metaphors. The Bible expects a lot of its reader and that’s ok.</li>\n<li>If a thing would be obvious to one of Mark’s original readers but not to a modern reader, clarify it using a parenthetical comment, hyphens, etc. Place these clarifications in italics or add a sidenote to preserve accountability for these being added thoughts not present in the original.</li>\n<li>Translate technical theological terms whenever necessary for comprehension among today’s largely-unchurched youth.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"examples-of-translating-technical-theological-terms\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#examples-of-translating-technical-theological-terms\" aria-label=\"examples of translating technical theological terms permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Examples of translating technical theological terms</h3><p>Repent / repentance: These words aren’t used at all in modern spoken English and especially not among our unchurched youth.</p><p>Sin: In colloquial use, this word simply means “a bad thing” or “a bad person”. But in common use today when the word is used at all it is frequently used in an ironic or sarcastic way. The effect is to change “sin” from an undesirable to a desirable thing—and sometimes even makes fun of the whole concept of sin to begin with.</p><p>Theologically this is beyond inaccurate. Further, we would never refer to someone as a “sinner” in spoken English (in the Bible sense of the word) outside a church. As a result, this author believes the word “sin” has completely lost its meaning in spoken English.</p><p>Consequently, in this instance I prefer to describe the general idea of “sin” rather than to use the word directly. But how? ”Sin” and “repent/repentance” are both very broad and general ideas that are developed throughout Scripture. Here are some principles I’ve used to resolve these difficulties.</p><ol>\n<li>When these ideas first appear in Mark, they do so in a context that already illuminates those ideas. For example, when John preaches “a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins” it is in the context of <em>preparing the way</em>, of <em>making his roads straight.</em> In this context I believe it is accurate and fair to translate repentance as requiring people *to choose God’s path. *In other words, in a context like this we can simply let the Bible interpret itself.</li>\n<li>In context, repentance is the antidote to sin, but what is the essence of sin? How can we express it succinctly in a way that makes sense in context? Considering the weight of Scripture, sin isn’t not just disobedience. It can be done in ignorance. It can be simply an inappropriate motive, thought, or intention driving an action that is in itself not sinful. For this I searched the Scriptures to find other descriptions of sin, even if the word itself wasn’t spelled out, and landed in James 4, “you do not have because you do not ask, or because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your own pleasures.”</li>\n</ol><p>Of course, because different parts of languages change differently over time there are few absolutes regarding the best approach in specific instance. For example, in some contexts I have felt it more appropriate to include the theological term used in the text, but with a (usually parenthetical) elaboration or explanation in the context. In other cases, I have found that an English word that is closely related to the original word that hasn’t yet lost its meaning and connotation.</p><p>For example, our culture’s understanding of <em>faith</em> is more-or-less accurate if one disregards the notion that some people advocate the idea that faith is fundamentally an irrational thing. So the word <em>faith</em> itself may not be wise to use. But in common use, other words derived from <em>faith</em> remain <em>faithful</em> to the Bible meaning.</p><p>In situations like this, I have preferred to use a derived English expression or an explanation next to the word making its meaning clear in context.</p><h3 id=\"additional-principles\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#additional-principles\" aria-label=\"additional principles permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Additional principles</h3><p>Retain Mark’s “overuse” of the word “immediately”. It is this author’s belief that Mark is intentionally using repetition to make a point.</p><p>When a global mechanical search-and-replace update works, use it to retain continuity with the underlying Greek when possible. For example: <em>Behold</em> → <em>Look!</em> Or: <em>multitude</em> → <em>large crowd; great multitude → very large crowd.</em></p><p>Many modern bibles include section headers describing the events or ideas immediately following. And most do a pretty good job of remaining descriptive rather than interpreting the text. Since the intent of this work is to not just update the English rendering of Mark’s gospel but to help unchurched and new believers to understand how to be a disciple of Jesus, I have chosen to change this convention as follows:</p><ul>\n<li>Instead of including headers inline with the text, I have chosen to add vertical white space separating sections.</li>\n<li>At the beginning of some sections I have included a footnote (marked using ^<strong>th</strong>^ as described in the footnote key) to a short phrase explaining a theme Mark is developing in the following story/thought in its context. These are intended to be similar to section headers in contemporary bibles, but as they offer commentary on the text are not included inline.</li>\n</ul></section>","timeToRead":7,"excerpt":"Introduction My goal in preparing this web site is to faithfully translate Mark’s book into contemporary spoken American English as used by…","frontmatter":{"title":"Principles","cover":"https://unsplash.it/400/300/?random?BigTest","date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["Mark"],"tags":null},"fields":{"slug":"/principles","date":"January 01, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/principles","nexttitle":"Big Test","nextslug":"/big-sample-test","prevtitle":"Mark 1","prevslug":"/mark-1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1421311927"]}
