Start with the three kinds of unfruitful soil above and apply each lesson to the degree you know how right now.

What attitudes keep you doing or thinking things you know are harmful?  List these and pray, asking God to help you change.  Then make a plan and begin changing.  Find someone else who can support you and keep you accountable.</span><label for=\"md-2-are-you-aware-of\" class=\"margin-toggle \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"md-2-are-you-aware-of\" class=\"margin-toggle\" /><span class=\"marginnote\">2) Are you aware of any things you do that are unhealthy or harmful toward yourself or others?  If you are unwilling to change these things, they become like the stones that keep Jesus’s Word from taking root in your heart.  List these.  Leave no stone unturned.  Ask God for forgiveness.  If you have harmed somebody else, do whatever you are able to do to make it right and ask for their forgiveness too.</span><label for=\"md-3-lastly-what-things\" class=\"margin-toggle \">&#8853;</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"md-3-lastly-what-things\" class=\"margin-toggle\" /><span class=\"marginnote\">3) Lastly, what things are you passionate about?  Being passionate toward something isn’t bad by itself.  But it’s bad if you begin to love it more than you love Jesus so that you stop paying attention to Jesus and his Word.  Ask God for help and begin placing healthy boundaries on these things.  Eliminate them if necessary.
