That is the bad news.</p><p>However, the good news for my generation is that many who are hungry to know the God of the Bible already have the required background to understand the Bible using many of the excellent modern translations.</p><p>On the other hand (in my own experience) many from the younger generation that is coming of age right now have none of this background understanding of theological terms needed to become a disciple of Jesus.</p><p>This is both an opportunity and a challenge.</p><h3 id=\"the-hunger\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-hunger\" aria-label=\"the hunger permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The hunger</h3><p>In my experience, I have never met a group of people more hungry to know about God generally and the God of the Bible specifically than this younger generation.

Many have found their way to becoming a disciple of Jesus through these synopses of the Good News.</p><p>But I believe that starting with Mark (because he alone claims to start at the beginning) and studying sequentially and <em>inductively</em> offers a more direct road into Jesus the Truth, Christ the Door, Jesus the Way, and Jesus the Life.  This approach depends simply on obtaining a faithful translation of Mark that itself translates these theological and/or cultural terms into understandable colloquial spoken English that any random native English speaker would readily comprehend.</p><p>I haven’t been able to find others with this vision, so I am beginning this work myself, in the open, hoping that others with skillsets complimenting my own offer their own expertise.  And hoping that in the end this work becomes an effort representative of the Body of Christ herself and her mission to effectively make disciples of Jesus before the last day comes.</p><h3 id=\"my-own-skillset\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#my-own-skillset\" aria-label=\"my own skillset permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>My own skillset</h3><p>I became a disciple of Jesus Christ as a middle-schooler and have been a passionate student of the Bible since.  While I have experienced seasons during which my strength or my total commitment to Jesus has faltered, I have never let go of my fundamental profound desire to be a disciple of Jesus and a student of the Bible.</p><p>I am not a Hebrew or Greek scholar but my wife is a Biblical Hebrew scholar and I’m not afraid of Greek interlinears and/or Hebrew/Greek lexicons.  These are a regular part of my personal study of the Scriptures.</p><p>Regarding Bible translation, I served a summer internship with Wycliffe Bible Translators as a high school student, grew up in the same church as Ken Taylor who originally updated the ASV–the result being published as The Living Bible paraphrase.  I am a friendly acquaintance of Mark Taylor (Ken’s son), and am familiar with many of the theological and political considerations surrounding a “layperson” updating an existing translation and having it remain properly a trustworthy translation instead of a “mere paraphrase.”</p><p>My main personal weakness is that I have very little background in textual criticism, and while I understand some fundamental principles such as “the ‘harder reading’ more likely being original” I cannot hope to evaluate alternate renderings myself the way a scholar with this training could.  To remediate this deficiency, I am relying on scholarly textual notes in the NET Bible 2.0, other study Bibles, and other readily-available scholarly resources.  And if any of these suggest an alternate rendering to be more accurate than the traditional ASV translation, I’ll cite my source(s)–probably in a footnote but this is undecided as this concern has yet to present itself.</p><p>Naturally, if a scholar with experience in Bible translation and (particularly with) expertise in textual criticism wishes to help address any possible weaknesses I bring in this area, I would be delighted to collaborate.</p></section>\n<section><h2 id=\"guiding-principles\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#guiding-principles\" aria-label=\"guiding principles permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Guiding principles</h2><p>My goal in preparing this translation is to faithfully update the American Standard Version of Mark into contemporary spoken American English as used by those who don’t already know anything of the Bible, have no theology background, and are generally unfamiliar with church culture.  </p><p>If you do not have a technical background in Bible translation and are still interested, read on.

In these situations, switch to dynamic equivalence while remaining as close to formal equivalence as possible.</p><p>These goals can be in tension with each other. The following principles guide how I have resolved these tensions. I’ve included specific examples where needed to clearly explain a thought.</p><ul>\n<li>Don’t change the meaning; simply update the style of English to the goals above.</li>\n<li>Retain Mark’s “overuse” of the word “immediately”. It is this author’s belief that Mark is intentionally using repetition to make a point.</li>\n<li>When a global mechanical search-and-replace update works, use it to retain continuity with the underlying Greek when possible. For example: <em>Behold</em> → <em>Look!</em>, <em>wilderness</em> → <em>desert</em>, <em>multitude</em> → <em>large crowd; great multitude → very large crowd.</em>, etc.</li>\n<li>When appropriate, change to active voice. For example, in 1:26: “The unclean spirit convulsed the man, shrieked loudly, and came out of him.”</li>\n<li>Simplify wording of lists to modern spoken English standards. 1:26 above is an example of this.</li>\n<li>A single thought gets a single sentence. Closely-related thoughts or those utilizing parallelism get a single sentence with semicolons separating each thought.</li>\n<li>Break up excessively long sentances.  But be careful to retain relative emphasis among thoughts present in the original.</li>\n<li>Used sparingly, sometimes sentance fragments can be effective as long as they don’t change the relative emphasis between the idea in the fragment and the run-on sentance being broken up.</li>\n<li>Many times the English is confusing because Mark used pronouns excessively or the referent of an expression is unclear without carefully studying the grammar of the context. While this may be the way Mark wrote, this is not considered high-quality spoken or written English. Resolve pronouns and other referents to their antecedents when doing this yields a clearer and equally-accurate reading.</li>\n<li>Use parentheses and hyphens (as appropriate) when a thought is interrupted by another one. Prefer using punctuation over rearranging word order.</li>\n<li>Rearrange word order only judiciously and being careful to preserve the emphases each individual idea in a sentence receives.</li>\n<li>If a direct or indirect object is separated from its referent, rearrange the word order to bring them together.</li>\n<li>For example, 2:14: As he passed by the tax office, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus working there. Here the ASV (and the Greek) separates “passed by” from its indirect object “the tax office” with an interjection about Jesus meeting Levi there. Putting the IO next to its verb makes the sentence immediately more comprehensible to a modern reader and also clarifies the fact that Levi was a tax collector.  This also clarifies the following story beginning in verse 18, without adding or removing from what was said.</li>\n<li>Don’t translate symbols or metaphors. The Bible expects a lot of its reader and that’s ok.  See above.</li>\n<li>If a thing would be obvious to one of Mark’s original readers but not to a modern reader, clarify it using rewording, a parenthetical comment, hyphens, etc.  Add a sidenote to preserve accountability.</li>\n<li>Translate technical theological terms whenever necessary for comprehension among today’s largely-unchurched youth.</li>\n<li>Start with the Greek literal translation.  Sometimes this directly offers an excellent substitute.  For example in 1:4, <em>baptize</em> → <em>ceremonially immerse [in water]</em>.</li>\n<li>Consider the immediate context.  For example, Mark uses the word <em>baptize</em> in two ways: the ceremonial way described above and also when <em>preaching baptism [of repentance for the forgiveness of sins]</em>.  This latter case can borrow from the context immediately preceeding combined with appropriate translation sidenotes: <em>need to immerse their affections[^ *a baptism</em>] in God’s straight paths instead of their own<label for=\"sd-less-than-em-greater\" class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\"></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"sd-less-than-em-greater\" class=\"margin-toggle\" /><span class=\"sidenote\"><em>of repentance</em></span>.*  See below for more examples.</li>\n<li>Consider the weight of Scripture.  Sometimes another scripture provides an excellent explanation or definition.  Continuing in verse 4, “a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness <em>of sins.”</em>  Here “sins” is used in general sense, so we need a concise, faithful expression describing “sin” in the general sense.  Here we can still let Scripture interpret Scripture by rendering this as “forgiven for <em>preferring selfish pleasure (and the hurt that this causes) instead”</em> along with a cross-reference to <em>James 4:1-3</em> from where this idea was directly lifted.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"more-discussion-about-translating-technical-theological-terms\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#more-discussion-about-translating-technical-theological-terms\" aria-label=\"more discussion about translating technical theological terms permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>More discussion about translating technical theological terms</h3><p>Repent / repentance: These words aren’t used at all in modern spoken English and especially not among our unchurched youth.</p><p>Sin: In colloquial English, this word simply means “a bad thing” or “a bad person”. But in common use today when the word is used at all it is frequently used in an ironic or sarcastic way. The effect is to change “sin” from an undesirable to a desirable thing—and sometimes even makes fun of the whole concept of sin to begin with.</p><p>Theologically this is beyond inaccurate. Further, we would rarely-to-never refer to someone as a “sinner” in spoken English in the Bible sense of the word outside a church (or even inside most churches). As a result, this author believes the word “sin” has completely lost its meaning in spoken English.</p><p>Other concerns happen because different parts of languages change differently over time so some English words’ meaning may still be largely faithful but need elaboration or careful adjustment.</p><p>In some of these cases I have felt it more appropriate to include the theological term used in the text, but with a (usually parenthetical) elaboration or explanation in the context.  <label for=\"sd-less-than-em-greater\" class=\"margin-toggle sidenote-number\"></label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"sd-less-than-em-greater\" class=\"margin-toggle\" /><span class=\"sidenote\"><em>Sometimes I’ve used a sidenote to clarify the original authorial intent when retaining a traditional rendering.</em></span></p><p>In other cases, I have found that an English word that is closely related to or derived from the original word that hasn’t yet lost its Bible meaning and connotation.</p><p>For example, our culture’s understanding of <em>faith</em> is more-or-less accurate–but only if one disregards that atheists and many scientists believe that faith is fundamentally an irrational or unscientific thing.</p><p>Consequently, I believe that perhaps the word <em>faith</em> itself may not be wise to use in a modern English translation.  However, in common use words derived from <em>faith</em> remain <em>faithful</em> to the Bible meaning, and in many cases we can <em>faithfully</em> use those to substitute for and/or to clarify in situations where <em>faith</em> is called for.</p></section>","timeToRead":12,"excerpt":"Why this project is necessary My experience speaking with others of my generation (commonly known as generation X) about the Bible and about…","frontmatter":{"title":"Why this project and what principles guide it?","cover":"https://unsplash.it/400/300/?random?BigTest","date":"2020-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["Mark"],"tags":null},"fields":{"slug":"/why-this-project-and-what-principles-guide-it","date":"December 21, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/why-this-project-and-what-principles-guide-it","nexttitle":"Mark 1","nextslug":"/mark-1","prevtitle":"Markdown Cheatsheet","prevslug":"/markdown-cheatsheet"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1421311927"]}
