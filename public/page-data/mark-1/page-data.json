Then the evil spirit came out of him.</p>\n<p><small><sup>27</sup></small>Everyone was amazed! </p>\n<p>They all wondered about this!  They all discussed the news!  “What is this? A new teaching? Jesus even commands the evil spirits with authority!  And they obey him!” they said.</p>\n<p><small><sup>28</sup></small>The news about Jesus immediately spread everywhere in the region known as “Galilee” and its surrounding area.</p>\n<p><small><sup>29</sup></small>Immediately, (when they had left the synagogue) they entered Simon and Andrew’s house with James and John.  <small><sup>30</sup></small>Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever and they told Jesus about her immediately.  <small><sup>31</sup></small>He came, took her by the hand, and raised her up.

Be cleansed.”  </p>\n<p><small><sup>42</sup></small>When Jesus said this, immediately the leprosy left the man—he was made clean; he was completely healed!</p>\n<p><small><sup>43</sup></small>Jesus strictly warned the man (immediately sending him on his way),  <small><sup>44</sup></small>“Be careful that you don’t speak a word about this to anybody. Instead, go show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices Moses commanded for your cleansing. (This will be a witness to the priests.)”</p>\n<p><small><sup>45</sup></small>However, when the man left, he told everybody and spread the news all over!  As a result, Jesus couldn’t enter cities any more but instead stayed outside the cities in the desert.</p>\n<p>People still came to Jesus from all around.</p>","timeToRead":5,"excerpt":"An invitation; a new beginning\n1The beginning of the Good News of Jesus, the one with God’s own authority, the Son of God.
