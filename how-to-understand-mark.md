(theme "The Beginning")
In his very first verse Mark offers an astonishing claim: That his book is the **beginning** of the Good News about Jesus, God's son.

Yet, a Western reader could easily be forgiven for wondering how Mark's collection of stories reflects **good news** for **us** to accept, adopt, and apply today.

So let's ask:

* How do we accept Mark's teaching--beyond understanding it as a collection of stories for learning moral principles?
* How do we adopt this teaching--when much of the book contains little overt teaching?
* How does it inform us in such a compelling way that the only reasonable response is to apply it to our own lives each day?

(theme "Principles for understanding Mark's teaching")
It **is** unusual today for a teacher to simply by tell stories without adding extra direction explaining what the teacher expects his or her students to take away for him/herself.  Here is how I resolve this dilemma for myself.

To understand Mark, I believe it is important to keep the following principles in mind:

1. Mark teaches primarily by example.
2. Mark wants us to read ourselves into the stories and to apply any lessons contained in the stories to the degree that they fit in our own lives.

That might sound confusing, so here are two thoughts to get you started.  Mark's book has two overarching points and basically asks two questions:

  * Will you be fully immersed--not just ceremonially, but in your heart also, as described in [chapter 1](/mark-1).
  * Who is Jesus?  What will you do with your understanding of Jesus?  If you could be among Jesus's listeners, with which group would you identify the most?  What kinds of things does Jesus say to the people you identify with the most?  Is Jesus right about you?  Do you like what this implies about you?

(theme "Ultimately Mark asks you to consider")
What will you change as--by seeing Jesus through Mark's eyes--you get to know Jesus more and more yourself?

And: You can't change as fundamentally as Mark recommends by trying to do better.  Will you admit this to yourself and to God--and ask God himself to help you to understand and to change?

Lastly: Are these changes worth it?  Mark, in writing his book, is betting that upon careful consideration you will agree that anything Jesus would want from you is more than worth any possible personal cost.

I would (along with Mark) invite you to come see for yourself.
